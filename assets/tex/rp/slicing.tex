        \item Creates a layer model from \acs{stl} files
        \item Every movement of the print head is calculated (only for \acs{fff})
        \item Many adjustment possibilities
        \item Accuracy/speed/material of print if defined here
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{exampleblock}{}
        The slicer generates G-code from the \acs{stl} file.
        This G-code depends on: printer, material, speed, accuracy, etc.
        In \acs{dlp} printing, a projected image is created for each layer.
